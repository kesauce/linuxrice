<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I've only ever known Linux to be an operating system for work-related problems and because I grew up on Windows, I never had the greatest urge to try it. That's before I found out what Linux Ricing was and the vast community it has. I quickly grabbed my old laptop that's been collecting dust and got to researching. I've always had a love for customising and desiging my own things and spaces so it greatly represents me. To be able to customise every detail of my computer is very exciting and I was very motivated to get to know Linux better.
